			<h3>Common Illness For Kids</h3>
            <p>Children's immune system is not yet fully developed, so the risk of getting sick is high. Especially in crowded and air-conditioned environments, pathogens will spread quickly. If children have habits such as sucking their fingers, biting their nails, picking up food, picking their noses, etc., the risk of infection is even greater.<br> </p>
            
            <h4> List of Common Illness in Kids:</h4><br><br>
        

            
            <h4>Influenza (the flu)</h4>
                <div class="container">
                    <div class="image">

                    <div class="text">
                    <p>Children will have cold-like symptoms such as high fever, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle aches, and pains. Young children and the elderly are greatly affected by this illness. Getting a flu shot each year is an effective way to prevent serious flu complications.</p>

                </div><br><br>

                <h4>HFMD(Hand, foot, and mouth disease)</h4>
                <div class="container">

                    <div class="text">
                    <p>Hand, foot, and mouth disease is common in young children, especially those under five years old. Hand, foot, and mouth disease rapidly spreads and easily becomes an epidemic. The peak of the illness is from March to May and from September to November every year. A small number of children can have severe complications if the signs of seriousness are not detected early and treated promptly.

                    <div class="text">
                    <p>Children who don't wash their dirty hands after playing will easily get digestive diseases. In addition, eating street food also makes children suffer from food poisoning and digestive disorders.Diarrhea is a common digestive disease for kids which is defined as having more frequent, loose, or watery stools than usual.If your child has diarrhea, it's important to keep them hydrated by offering plenty of fluids.

                <h4  style="text-align: center">Seasonal Allergies</h4><br>
                <p>Seasonal allergies are sometimes called "hay fever" or seasonal allergic rhinitis. These allergy symptoms happen during certain times of the year, usually when trees, grasses, and weeds release tiny pollen particles into the air to fertilize other plants.</p>

                      <h4>Get vaccinated</h4>
                    <p>Get vaccinated to support the immune system, helping children avoid dangerous infections. Therefore, parents should check the vaccination record so that they do not forget the reminder shots such as flu, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, chickenpox, pneumonia, measles - mumps - rubella (MMR)

                    <p>Ensuring  children are eating healthy foods and getting proper nutrition is  the fundamental step to boost their immune system. By "healthy" we define a diet with lots of fruits and vegetables (five servings a day are recommended, and they should take up half of every meal plate), whole grains, and lean protein.

                      <h4>Get them active</h4>
                    <p>Exercise keeps us healthy and less likely to get sick. Children should really be active for an hour a day. "Active" doesn’t have to mean playing a sport or going to the gym; it could be playing at the playground,swimming in the pool or going for a walk.
