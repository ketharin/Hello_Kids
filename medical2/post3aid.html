			<h3>First Aid for kids</h3>

It enables you to assist persons who become injured in the event of an accident or emergency situation until help arrives.</p>

          <h4>Calling For Help</h4>
        <p>When you are in a situation which needs first aid, you need to communicate clearly by talking to them and explaining what is happening which will help them to feel reassured.Sometimes, you will need a lot more help than you are able to give. The best thing you can do is phone for emergency help. Phone your national emergency helpline(s).

    <p>Go through the first aid kit together, and have some extra bits of gauze, tape, and cotton balls on hand so your child can practice with real tools: smaller kids get a special thrill out of these materials. Make sure your family kit is well organized so a child can find recognizable tools quickly, and have illustrated instruction pamphlets on hand.</p>
